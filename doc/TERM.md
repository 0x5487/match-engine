## PostOnly

PostOnly is a type of order that is used to add liquidity to the crypto market. It means that your order will only be executed if it does not match with any existing order on the order book1. If your order would cross the spread and take liquidity from the market, it will be rejected2. PostOnly orders are useful when you want to avoid paying fees as a market taker and earn rebates as a market maker1.
